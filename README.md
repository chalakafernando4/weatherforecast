# Weather Forecasting using RNN

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for weather forecasting, developed during an internship at the meteorological department. The model processes sequential weather data to predict future conditions effectively.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficiently handles and processes time-series weather data.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes RNN layers to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Includes metrics and visualizations to analyze model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecasting-rnn.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd weather-forecasting-rnn
   ```

3. **Run the training script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Results
The model provides predictions for future weather conditions based on historical data. Results include:
- Performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual values.

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Main script for training the RNN model.
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets.
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints.
- `results/`: Folder for output graphs and metrics.
